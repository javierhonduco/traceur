## traceur

#### traceur is a simple raytracer coded in javascript 
(and depending on no external library.)

#### inspiration
an assignment I've done for Aalto university's Computer Graphics course and heavily inspired form a script from antirez called jsrt.

#### future ideas
* [ ] implement triangles from the cpp file
* [ ] improve the code
* [ ] add planes and maybe boxes
* [ ] implement supersampling as an antialising technique
* [ ] try to optimize the code with some kindof parallelism in js (?)
